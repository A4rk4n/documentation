## Contribution Guidelines

If you are submitting documentation for the **current stable release**, submit it to the corresponding branch. For example, documentation for mcss 11 would be submitted to the `11.x.x` branch. Documentation intended for the next release of mcss should be submitted to the `master` branch.
